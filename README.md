#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In 
**Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized 
displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless 
offline experience for users.

### How to run

1. Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.

2. Run 'grunt' to run default grunt tasks

3. cd to newly created 'build' folder

4. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to 
do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m 
SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (Use port 8000 specifically!!) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 
8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the 
software.

5. Go to localhost:8000 in your browser.
